The platform is designed as a Multi-Tenant SaaS, giving each organization its own isolated environment with individual configuration.

## Core Features

### Multi-Channel Communication
ARIIA supports communication across multiple channels simultaneously: WhatsApp Business API, Telegram Bot, Voice AI (Phone), SMS, and Web Widget. All channels are managed centrally in a unified dashboard. Messages are synchronized across channels, allowing customers to seamlessly switch between them.

### Multi-Agent Orchestration (Project Titan)
The heart of ARIIA is the Multi-Agent architecture "Project Titan". Instead of a single chatbot, specialized AI agents work together as a swarm. An Orchestrator Agent analyzes incoming requests and delegates them to the appropriate specialist – such as the Scheduling Agent, the Sales Agent, or the Support Agent. This architecture enables significantly higher response quality than monolithic chatbots.

### 3-Tier Memory System
ARIIA features a three-tier memory system: Short-term Memory (current conversation), Long-term Memory (customer preferences and history), and Context Memory (organization-specific knowledge). This enables the AI agent to provide personalized responses and remember previous interactions.

### Vision AI
The Vision Agent can analyze images that customers send – such as product photos for identification, document photos for digitization, or reference images for visual support.

### CRM & Platform Integration
Direct API connections to leading platforms enable ARIIA to retrieve customer data, view contracts, book appointments, and check payment status – all automatically and in real-time. Supported platforms include HubSpot, Salesforce, Shopify, WooCommerce, Stripe, Calendly, and more.

### Real-time Analytics Dashboard
The dashboard displays KPIs such as ticket volume, AI Resolution Rate, average confidence scores, response times, and channel distribution. Administrators can monitor the performance of their AI agents in real-time.

### Knowledge Base
The central knowledge management system allows organizations to store their specific knowledge (business hours, services, pricing, FAQ). The AI agent uses this knowledge for precise responses.

### Contact Memory
Individual customer profiles store preferences, goals, communication history, and personal notes. The AI agent uses this information for personalized interactions across all channels.

### Campaign Management
Organizations can create and send automated marketing campaigns across all channels – such as welcome messages for new customers, birthday greetings, or re-engagement campaigns for inactive customers.

### Escalation Management
When the AI agent cannot answer a request or the confidence score is too low, it automatically escalates to a human agent. The system supports both automatic and manual escalation with full context handoff.

### Churn Prevention
AI-driven behavioral analysis identifies customers at risk of canceling based on engagement patterns, interaction frequency, and sentiment analysis. Proactive outreach campaigns can be triggered automatically.
