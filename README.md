# ARIIA – Multi-Tenant AI Agent Platform for Fitness Studios

**ARIIA** (formerly ARNI) is a sophisticated, multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to automate and enhance member interactions for fitness studios. It acts as a digital front-desk assistant, leveraging a powerful AI agent swarm to manage communications, bookings, and member support across multiple channels like WhatsApp, Telegram, and Voice.

## ✨ Core Features

ARIIA has evolved far beyond a simple chatbot into a comprehensive studio management and automation platform. The current version is a production-ready, multi-tenant SaaS application.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Multi-Tenant SaaS** | Securely manage multiple independent fitness studios (tenants) with isolated data, configurations, and billing. |
| **AI Agent Swarm** | A "Project Titan" Orchestrator-Worker architecture delegates tasks to specialized agents (Ops, Sales, Medic, Vision) for superior problem-solving. |
| **Studio Deck** | A comprehensive web frontend (Next.js) for tenant admins to monitor conversations, manage members, view analytics, and configure the system. |
| **Multi-Channel Comms** | Seamlessly integrates with **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, and **Voice** (STT/TTS), normalizing messages into a unified pipeline. |
| **Advanced CRM** | Rich member profiles with activity tracking, booking history, preference analysis, and automated data enrichment via **Magicline** integration. |
| **Churn Prediction** | Proactively identifies at-risk members using activity data and configurable churn-scoring rules. |
| **3-Tier Memory System** | Combines short-term (Redis), long-term (PostgreSQL), and knowledge-base (Markdown files) memory for deep, contextual conversations. |
| **Billing & Subscriptions** | A robust feature-gating system manages different SaaS plans (Starter, Pro, Enterprise) and enforces usage limits. |
| **Security & Governance** | Built with enterprise-grade security, including strict authentication, tenant data isolation (RLS), and encrypted API keys. |

## 🏛️ Architecture

The system is designed as a decoupled, service-oriented architecture, orchestrated via a central Redis message bus. This ensures scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The entire platform is containerized and can be launched with a single command using Docker Compose.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Docker & Docker Compose
*   An `.env` file configured with your API keys and secrets (see `.env.example`).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DamienDrash/arni.git
cd arni

# 2. Configure your environment
cp .env.example .env
# nano .env  <-- Add your OPENAI_API_KEY, AUTH_SECRET, etc.

# 3. Launch the platform
docker compose up --build
```

Your services will be available at:
*   **Studio Deck (Frontend):** `http://localhost:3000`
*   **ARIIA Gateway (Backend):** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
