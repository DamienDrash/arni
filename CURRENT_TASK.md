## 🚀 Project Titan: Achievements

### 1. Orchestrator Architecture ("Arnold Prime")
- **Central Intelligence:** The `MasterAgent` handles all user interactions, maintaining a consistent persona.
- **Worker Swarm:** `Ops`, `Sales`, `Medic`, and `Vision` act as specialized tools, returning structured data instead of chat.
- **Parallel Execution:** The Orchestrator can consult multiple specialists in a single turn (Multi-Hop Reasoning).

### 2. Intelligent Memory (Gold Standard)
- **Silent Flush 2.0:** Uses LLM extraction to capture semantic facts (Goals, Injuries, Preferences) instead of regex.
- **Librarian Service:** Background task that summarizes old sessions into narrative episodes for "Infinite Context".
- **Robust Retrieval:** 3-Tier fallback (Vector -> ID-Match -> Markdown File) ensures 100% data availability.

### 3. Empathy & Retention
- **De-Escalation Protocol:** The Sales agent prioritizes emotional validation over data collection during complaints.
- **Loyalty Bridge:** The Persona agent actively uses long-term memory (e.g., Marathon goal) to motivate users during frustration.

### 4. Enterprise Security & Stability
- **PII Shield:** Automatic masking of sensitive data (Phone, Email, IBAN) in the persistence layer.
- **Anti-Loop:** Agents detect and break redundant tool-call loops.
- **Tenant Isolation:** Strict data separation for Knowledge Base and Member Memory.

## Next Steps (Roadmap)
- **Sprint 3:** Communication Layer Polish (WhatsApp/Telegram normalization).
- **Sprint 4:** Advanced Vision features (Gym occupancy analysis).
